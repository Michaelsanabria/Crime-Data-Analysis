# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Crime Data Analytics Dashboard

This project is a data analytics and visualization tool focused on analyzing crime trends, patterns, and correlations in [City/Region] using publicly available crime datasets. The goal is to provide actionable insights through visual storytelling, enabling better understanding of how crime varies across time, location, and categories.

## üîç Project Overview

This project explores historical crime data from [Dataset Source, e.g., "Los Angeles Open Data Portal"] spanning from [Start Year] to [End Year]. It includes:

- Data wrangling and preprocessing of raw CSV data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trend analysis across time (daily, monthly, yearly)
- Geospatial mapping of high-crime areas
- Correlation between crime types and socioeconomic indicators (optional)
- Interactive visualizations using [e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, or Folium]

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand overall crime trends over time
- Identify crime hotspots using heatmaps
- Determine the most common crime types and their seasonal patterns
- Analyze the relationship between time of day and specific crime types
- Build a foundation for predictive crime modeling in future phases

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium, Scikit-learn (optional)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Lab, VSCode, Git/GitHub
- **Data Source:** [Link to Dataset]
